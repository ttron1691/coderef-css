# Code Reference for CSS
## CSS Selectors
Assign style for all elements of a given class
The basic style of a CSS file looks as follows
```CSS
selector {
    property1: value1;
    property2: value2;
}
```
Example for customizing the paragraph class
```CSS
p {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
```
A style definition based on IDs of an element is given by
```CSS
#mystyle1 {
  text-align: center;
  color: red;
}
```
